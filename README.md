# The-Game-Room

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

This document was exploring the best operating system environment to use for the client, The Gaming Room. The client wanted us to design a game called "Draw It or Lose It which is a web-based game based on Android architecture. This game should be able to support multiple teams with each game instance only being able to occur once in memory.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Drawing out the necessary requirements that it would take for the client to be able to develop, publish and manage their game. While also showing the design constraints that come with different operating systems, showing their strengths while also showing their drawbacks for each.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Laying out the different requirements and what the game had to specifically do in the document gave me the necessary information to then start to create code in order to function the way the client would like the game to be.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The development requirements. I feel as though there could have been more information to be added or even expand on a lot of the different requirements for each operating system as a whole. With how intricate operating systems are now there are a lot of different aspects that need to be addressed to make sure that the client can make a very well informed decision.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I looked primarily on how the game functioned and how the client wanted the game to function. Using this information, it helped split up the work and focusing on one aspect of the game at a time and addressing the functionality between the different operating systems.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I focused primarily on making each aspect of the design document clear and as concise as possible while also laying out the necessary wording so that the client would understand the overall design of the software. Also, allowing the seperation of the games needs and it's functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
